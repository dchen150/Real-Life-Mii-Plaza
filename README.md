nwHacks 2020 Google Cloud first place winner!!!

# Inspiration
Approaching new people in events is really daunting and having some information beforehand (such as interests/pronouns) helps get the conversation started.

# What it does
The android app is a 2 part application - registration and search. Users first register themselves on our database providing a picture of themselves, their name, and a few of their interests. Using the search functionality, users can scan the area for anyone that has registered in the app. If a person's face is recognized in the search, their information will be displayed on screen!

# How we built it
The entire app uses Android Studio, XML, and Java. The registration functionality relies on Google Cloud Firebase, and the search functionality uses Microsoft Azure Face API.

# Challenges we ran into
Because Firebase returns data asynchronously, it was challenging to work with calls to Firebase and threads.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of
- Getting data properly from Firebase
- Consistent facial verification between database photos and Microsoft Azure

# What we learned
- How to work with APIs from both Google and Microsoft
- Building Android applications

# What's next for first hello
Larger scaling/better performance, display information in AR
